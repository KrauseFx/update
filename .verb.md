## About

### What does it do?

All updating is accomplished using plugins called _updaters_, which are run by command line or API, and can be installed globally, locally, or created in a local `updatefile.js`.

You can create your own [updaters](docs/updaters.md) using Update's API, or install updaters using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), to do things like:

* create continuity and consistency across projects
* enforce conventions across all of your projects
* instantly update an old or inherited project to your latest personal preferences (convert tabs to spaces, convert from `jshint` to `eslint` or the other way around, or any other detail)
* reformat code to meet your standards
* convert a config file to a different format (json to yaml, yaml to json, etc)
* update files that are typically excluded from build cycles, and are often forgotten about after they're created. For example:
  - fix dates in copyrights, [licenses](https://github.com/update/updater-license) and banners
  - remove deprecated fields from [project manifests](https://github.com/update/updater-package)
  - update settings in [runtime config](https://github.com/update/updater-eslint) files, preferences in [dotfiles](https://github.com/update/updater-editorconfig)
* after initializing a new project with a project generator, like [generate][] or Google's Yeoman, you can "normalize" all of the generated files to use your own preferences

### Why update? 

- **be more productive**: Update makes you more productive by eliminating time spent on things that _can be automated_, but typically aren't since they don't need to be done often, don't fit into the build cycle or a project's deliverables, or they're usually updated by hand. As code projects mature, time spent on these things tend to stay linear or increase as the size of a community grows. And this only compounds with each new project under your stewardship. 
- **your way, instantly**: updaters can be published to and installed from npm, but you can also easily create your own [personal updaters](docs/symlinking-updaters.md). Once your updaters are setup, just run `update init`, then projects under your maintenance will convert to the the conventions you prefer within milliseconds after running `update`.
- **plugin ecosystem**: any plugins that work with [Base applications](#discovering-plugins) will work also with Update. Which means you can use plugins (or generators) from [assemble][], [verb][], and [generate][], to name a few.
- **well tested**: with more than 1,200 unit tests

### Who should use Update?

* anyone who cares about having consistency across all of their projects
* developers or organizations with many projects under their stewardship
* agencies or consultants who maintain and/or create client projects and would like to reduce time spent on maintainance 

## Getting started

The following instructions are intended to provide a basic demonstration of how Update works. Visit the links after this section for more information.

**1. Install update**

To use Update's CLI, `update` must first be installed globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --global update
```

This adds the `update` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from anywhere.

**2. Install an "updater"**

To see how updaters work, install `updater-example`:

```sh
$ npm install --global updater-example
```

**3. Create "example.txt"**

In the current working directory, create an empty file named `example.txt`.

**4. Run**

As a habit, when using `update` make sure your work is committed, then run:

```sh
$ update example
```

This appends the string `foo` to the contents of `example.txt`. Visit the [updater-example][] project for additional steps and guidance.

- Get [Sublime Text Snippets][snippets] for creating tasks and updaters

## Init

Tell Update's CLI to automatically run certain updaters every time the `update` command is given:

```sh
$ update init
```

You can run this command whenever you want to update your preferences, like after installing new updaters.

```console
$ update help

  Usage: update <command> [options]

  Command: updater or tasks to run

  Options:

    --config, -c      Save a configuration value to the `update` object in package.json
    --cwd             Set or display the current working directory
    --data, -d        Define data. API equivalent of `app.data()`
    --disable         Disable an option. API equivalent of "app.disable('foo')"
    --enable          Enable an option. API equivalent of "app.enable('foo')"
    --global, -g      Save a global configuration value to use as a default
    --help, -h        Display this help menu
    --init, -i        Prompts for configuration values and stores the answers
    --option, -o      Define options. API equivalent of `app.option()`
    --run             Force tasks to run regardless of command line flags used
    --silent, -S      Silence all tasks and updaters in the terminal
    --show <key>      Display the value of <key>
    --version, -V     Display the current version of update
    --verbose, -v     Display all verbose logging messages

  Examples:

    # run updater "foo"
    $ update foo

    # run task "bar" from updater "foo"
    $ update foo:bar

    # run multiple tasks from updater "foo"
    $ update foo:bar,baz,qux

    # run a sub-generator from updater "foo"
    $ update foo.abc

    # run task "xyz" from sub-generator "foo.abc"
    $ update foo.abc:xyz

    Update attempts to automatically determine if "foo" is a task or updater.
    If there is a conflict, you can force update to run updater "foo"
    by specifying its default task. Example: `$ update foo:default`
```

## Features

* **unparalleled flow control**: through the use of [updaters](docs/updaters.md), [sub-updaters][getting-started] and [tasks](docs/tasks.md)
* **generators**: support for [generate][] generators. If your updater needs to create new files, there might be a [generator for that](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/generate-generator). Just use the generator the same way you would use an [updater](docs/updaters.md).
* **render templates**: use templates to create new files, or replace existing files 
* **prompts**: It's easy to create custom prompts. Answers to prompts can be used as context for rendering templates, for settings options, determining file names, directory structure, and anything else that requires user feedback.
* **any engine**: use any template engine to render templates, including [handlebars][], [lodash][], [swig][] and [pug][], or anything supported by [consolidate][].
* **data**: gather data from the user's environment to populate "hints" in user prompts or for rendering templates
* **fs**: in the spirit of [gulp][], use `.src` and `.dest` to read and write globs of files.
* **vinyl**: files and templates are [vinyl][] files
* **streams**: full support for [gulp][] and [assemble][] plugins
* **smart plugins**: Update is built on [base][], so any "smart" plugin from the Base ecosystem can be used
* **stores**: persist configuration settings, global defaults, project-specific defaults, answers to prompts, and so on.
* much more! 

## Discovering updaters
