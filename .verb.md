## What is update?

Update is a new, open-source developer framework for automating updates of any kind to code projects. 

## CLI

**Installing the CLI**

To run update from the command line, you'll need to install it globally first. You can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm i -g update
```

This adds the `update` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory. 

You should now be able to use the `update` command to execute code in a local `updatefile.js` file, or to execute globally installed updaters by their [aliases](#aliases).

**Init**

If it's your first time using update, run `update init` to set your global defaults.


**CLI help**

```
Usage: update <command> [options]

Command: Generator or tasks to run

Examples:

  # run the "foo" updater
  $ update foo

  # run the "bar" task on updater "foo"
  $ update foo:bar

  # run multiple tasks on updater "foo"
  $ update foo:bar,baz,qux

  # run a sub-updater on updater "foo"
  $ update foo.abc

  # run task "xyz" on sub-updater "foo.abc"
  $ update foo.abc:xyz

  Update attempts to automatically determine if "foo" is a task or updater.
  If there is a conflict, you can force update to run updater "foo"
  by specifying a task on the updater. Example: `update foo:default`
```

## Quickstart

The following intro only skims the surface of what update has to offer. For a more in-depth introduction, we highly recommend visiting the [getting started guide][getting-started]. 

**Create a updater**

Add a `updatefile.js` to the current working directory with the following code:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  console.log('success!');
};
```

**Run a updater**

Enter the following command:

```sh
update
```

If successful, you should see `success!` in the terminal. 

**Create a task**

Now, add a task to your updater.

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.task('default', function(cb) {
    console.log('success!');
    cb();
  });
};
```

Now, in the command line, run:

```sh
$ update
# then try
$ update default
```

When a local `updatefile.js` exists, the `update` command is aliased to automatically run the `default` task if one exists. But you can also run the task with `update default`. 

**Run a task**

Let's try adding more tasks to your updater:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.task('default', function(cb) {
    console.log('default > success!');
    cb();
  });
  
  app.task('foo', function(cb) {
    console.log('foo > success!');
    cb();
  });

  app.task('bar', function(cb) {
    console.log('bar > success!');
    cb();
  });
};
```

Now, in the command line, run:

```sh
$ update
# then try
$ update foo
# then try
$ update foo bar
```

**Run task dependencies**

Now update your code to the following:


```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.task('default', ['foo', 'bar']);
  
  app.task('foo', function(cb) {
    console.log('foo > success!');
    cb();
  });

  app.task('bar', function(cb) {
    console.log('bar > success!');
    cb();
  });
};
```

And run:

```sh
$ update
```

You're now a master at running tasks with update! You can do anything with update tasks that you can do with [gulp][] tasks (we use and support gulp libraries after all!).

But update does much more than this. For a more in-depth introduction, we highly recommend visiting the [getting started guide][getting-started]. 

## More info

### Feature highlights

Update offers an elegant and robust suite of methods, carefully organized to help you accomplish common activities in less time, including:

- **unparalleled flow control**: through the use of [updaters][getting-started], [sub-updaters][getting-started] and [tasks][getting-started]
- **templates, scaffolds and boilerplates**: update a single file, initialize an entire project, or provide ad-hoc "components" throughout the duration of a project using any combination of [templates, scaffolds and boilerplates](#templates-scaffolds-and-boilerplates).
- **any engine**: use any template engine to render templates, including [handlebars][], [lodash][], [swig][] and [pug][]
- **prompts**: asks you for data when it can't find what it needs, and it's easy to customize prompts for any data you want.
- **data**: gathers data from the user's environment to populate "hints" in user prompts and render templates
- **streams**: interact with the file system, with full support for [gulp][] and [assemble][] plugins
- **smart plugins**: Update is built on [base][], so any "smart" plugin can be used
- **stores**: persist configuration settings, global defaults, project-specific defaults, answers to prompts, and so on.

### FAQ

<a name="aliases">
**What's an alias, and what do they do?**

Update tries to find globally installed updaters using an "alias" first, falling back on the updater's full name if not found by its alias. 

A updater's alias is created by stripping the substring `update-` from the _full name_ of updater. Thus, when publishing a updater the naming convention `update-foo` should be used (where `foo` is the alias, and `update-foo` is the full name). 

Note that **no dots may be used in published updater names**. Aside from that, any characters considered valid by npm are fine.
