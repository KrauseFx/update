## Why use Update?

You can install [updaters](docs/updaters.md) from npm, or create your own updaters to do things like:

* normalize configuration settings, verbiage, or preferences across all of your projects
* update files that are typically excluded from build cycles, and are often forgotten about after they're created. For example:
  - fix dates in copyrights, [licenses](https://github.com/update/updater-license) and banners
  - remove deprecated fields from [project manifests](https://github.com/update/updater-package)
  - update settings in [runtime config](https://github.com/update/updater-eslint) files, preferences in [dotfiles](https://github.com/update/updater-editorconfig)
* after initializing a new project with a project generator, like [generate][] or Google's Yeoman, you can "normalize" all of the generated files to use your own preferences

## Fast track

The following instructions are intended to provide a basic demonstration of how Update works. Follow the links after this section for additional information.

**1. Install update**

To use Update's CLI, `update` must first be installed globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --global update
```

This adds the `update` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from anywhere.

**2. Install an "updater"**

To see how updaters work, install `updater-example`:

```sh
$ npm install --global updater-example
```

**3. Create "example.txt"**

In the current working directory, create an empty file named `example.txt`.

**4. Run**

As a habit, when using `update` make sure your work is committed, then run:

```sh
$ update example
```

This simply appends the string `foo`. Visit the [updater-example][] project for additional steps and guidance.

## Init

Tell Update's CLI to automatically run certain updaters every time the `update` command is given:

```sh
$ update init
```

You can run this command whenever you want to update your preferences, like after installing new updaters.

## The basics

**Usage**

* Once installed globally, Update's CLI can be executed with the `$ update` command
* All of the actual _updating_ is accomplished by plugins called [updaters](docs/updaters.md)

**Updaters**

* You can create your own custom [updaters](docs/updaters.md), or install them from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Discover updaters on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/keywords/update-updater) using the `update-updater` keyword
* See the [updater API docs](docs/api/updater.md) to learn how to create updaters.
* From the command line, pass the names of one or more updaters to run after the `$ update` command. For example:
  - To run `updater-foo`, you would do: `$ update foo`
  - To run multiple updaters, like `foo`, `bar` and `baz`, you would do: `$ update foo bar baz` 
* Using the API, pass the names of one or more updaters to run to the `.update` method. For example:
  - To run `updater-foo`, you would do: `app.update('foo', function(err) {})`
  - To run muliple updaters, you would do: `app.update(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], function(err) {})`
* If using Update's API, updaters are registered with the `.register` or `.updater` methods (see the [updater docs](docs/updaters.md) for more details about these methods).
* Any updater can register other updaters, and any updater can be registered by other updaters
* Updaters always run _in series_, thus they will always wait for the previous updater to finish before executing.

**Tasks**

* Tasks can be defined inside updaters using the `app.task()` method
* Tasks are powered by [bach][] and use the same conventions as [gulp][]
* From the command line:
  - To run task `abc` belonging to updater `foo`, you would run `$ update foo:abc`
  - To run tasks `abc` and `xyz` belonging to updater `foo`, you would run `$ update foo:abc,xyz`
* Tasks always run _in series_, thus they will always wait for the previous task to finish before executing.

**updatefile.js**

- If an [updatefile.js](docs/updatefile.md) exists in the current working directory, Update's CLI will load it and register it as the ["default" updater](docs/updaters.md#default-updater)
- Using an `updatefile.js` provides a convenient way of testing and developing updaters. But you can also create your own ["private" updaters](docs/updaters.md#private-updaters) this way
- Update's CLI will look on the default updater for tasks and (other) updaters to run before looking elsewhere.

**Publishing updaters**

- Updaters can be published to npm using the `updater-foo` naming convention, where `foo` is the updater's [alias](docs/faq.md#aliases).
- Updaters that are published to npm can be [installed locally or globally](docs/installing-updaters.md)

## Features

* **unparalleled flow control**: through the use of [updaters][getting-started], [sub-updaters][getting-started] and [tasks][getting-started]
* **templates, scaffolds and boilerplates**: update a single file, initialize an entire project, or provide ad-hoc "components" throughout the duration of a project using any combination of [templates, scaffolds and boilerplates](#templates-scaffolds-and-boilerplates).
* **any engine**: use any template engine to render templates, including [handlebars][], [lodash][], [swig][] and [pug][]
* **prompts**: asks you for data when it can't find what it needs, and it's easy to customize prompts for any data you want.
* **data**: gathers data from the user's environment to populate "hints" in user prompts and render templates
* **streams**: interact with the file system, with full support for [gulp][] and [assemble][] plugins
* **smart plugins**: Update is built on [base][], so any "smart" plugin can be used
* **stores**: persist configuration settings, global defaults, project-specific defaults, answers to prompts, and so on.
* much more!
