Update is a new developer framework and CLI for automating updates of any kind in code projects. All updating is accomplished using plugins called _updaters_, which are run by command line or API, and can be installed globally, locally, or in a local `updatefile.js`.

Please read our [contributing guide](.github/contributing.md) if you'd like to learn more about contributing to this project.

## What does it do?

You can create your own [updaters](docs/updaters.md) using Update's API, or install updaters using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), to do things like:

* enforce conventions across all of your projects
* instantly update an old or inherited project to your latest personal preferences (convert tabs to spaces, convert from `jshint` to `eslint` or the other way around, or any other detail)
* reformat code to meet your standards
* convert a config file to a different format (json to yaml, yaml to json, etc)
* update files that are typically excluded from build cycles, and are often forgotten about after they're created. For example:
  - fix dates in copyrights, [licenses](https://github.com/update/updater-license) and banners
  - remove deprecated fields from [project manifests](https://github.com/update/updater-package)
  - update settings in [runtime config](https://github.com/update/updater-eslint) files, preferences in [dotfiles](https://github.com/update/updater-editorconfig)
* after initializing a new project with a project generator, like [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) or Google's Yeoman, you can "normalize" all of the generated files to use your own preferences

## Why update?

**Shared plugin ecosystem**

Update is built on [base](https://github.com/node-base/base), a developer framework and API for rapidly building high quality node.js applications, using plugins like building blocks. This means that, in addition to plugins created just for Update, plugins from any [other Base application](#in-the-wild) can be used to add functionality to your updaters as well.

**Learn one, learn them all**

Moreover, once you learn how to use Update, or any other Base application, you will have at least a firm understanding of how to use the others, if not a good head start.

**Plays well with others**

Update is valueable by itself and can be used completely standalone. But it's even better when used with complementary frameworks that address other parts of the software development lifecycle, such as:

* [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate): create projects
* [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble): build projects
* [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb): document projects

## Who should use Update?

* anyone who cares about having consistency across all of their projects
* developers or organizations with many projects under their stewardship
* agencies or consultants who maintain and/or create client projects and would like to reduce time spent on maintainance

## Getting started

The following instructions are intended to provide a basic demonstration of how Update works. Visit the links after this section for more information.

**1. Install update**

To use Update's CLI, `update` must first be installed globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --global update
```

This adds the `update` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from anywhere.

**2. Install an "updater"**

To see how updaters work, install `updater-example`:

```sh
$ npm install --global updater-example
```

**3. Create "example.txt"**

In the current working directory, create an empty file named `example.txt`.

**4. Run**

As a habit, when using `update` make sure your work is committed, then run:

```sh
$ update example
```

This appends the string `foo` to the contents of `example.txt`. Visit the [updater-example](https://github.com/update/updater-example) project for additional steps and guidance.

* Learn about [updaters](docs/updaters.md)
* Learn about the [built-in updaters](docs/cli/built-in-updaters.md)

## Init

Tell Update's CLI to automatically run certain updaters every time the `update` command is given:

```sh
$ update init
```

You can run this command whenever you want to update your preferences, like after installing new updaters.

```console
$ update help

  Usage: update <command> [options]

  Command: updater or tasks to run

  Options:

    --config, -c      Save a configuration value to the `update` object in package.json
    --cwd             Set or display the current working directory
    --data, -d        Define data. API equivalent of `app.data()`
    --disable         Disable an option. API equivalent of "app.disable('foo')"
    --enable          Enable an option. API equivalent of "app.enable('foo')"
    --global, -g      Save a global configuration value to use as a default
    --help, -h        Display this help menu
    --init, -i        Prompts for configuration values and stores the answers
    --option, -o      Define options. API equivalent of `app.option()`
    --run             Force tasks to run regardless of command line flags used
    --silent, -S      Silence all tasks and updaters in the terminal
    --show <key>      Display the value of <key>
    --version, -V     Display the current version of update
    --verbose, -v     Display all verbose logging messages

  Examples:

    # run updater "foo"
    $ update foo

    # run task "bar" from updater "foo"
    $ update foo:bar

    # run multiple tasks from updater "foo"
    $ update foo:bar,baz,qux

    # run a sub-generator from updater "foo"
    $ update foo.abc

    # run task "xyz" from sub-generator "foo.abc"
    $ update foo.abc:xyz

    Update attempts to automatically determine if "foo" is a task or updater.
    If there is a conflict, you can force update to run updater "foo"
    by specifying its default task. Example: `$ update foo:default`
```

## Features

* **unparalleled flow control**: through the use of [updaters](https://github.com/update/getting-started), [sub-updaters](https://github.com/update/getting-started) and [tasks](https://github.com/update/getting-started)
* **templates, scaffolds and boilerplates**: update a single file, initialize an entire project, or provide ad-hoc "components" throughout the duration of a project using any combination of [templates, scaffolds and boilerplates](#templates-scaffolds-and-boilerplates).
* **any engine**: use any template engine to render templates, including [handlebars](http://www.handlebarsjs.com/), [lodash](https://lodash.com/), [swig](https://github.com/paularmstrong/swig) and [pug](http://jade-lang.com)
* **prompts**: asks you for data when it can't find what it needs, and it's easy to customize prompts for any data you want.
* **data**: gathers data from the user's environment to populate "hints" in user prompts and render templates
* **streams**: interact with the file system, with full support for [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) plugins
* **smart plugins**: Update is built on [base](https://github.com/node-base/base), so any "smart" plugin can be used
* **stores**: persist configuration settings, global defaults, project-specific defaults, answers to prompts, and so on.
* much more!
