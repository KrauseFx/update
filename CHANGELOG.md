**v0.6.0**

- Swap out [base][] for [assemble-core][] (which uses Base via [templates][]). This allows updaters to seamlessly run generators from [generate][], [assemble][], or [verb][] (when a file needs to be created, or re-created for example)
- Adds [assemble-loader][] to support glob patterns in collection methods
