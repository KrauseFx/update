## The basics

- All of the actual _updating_ is accomplished by plugins called "updaters". 
- [Updaters](docs/updaters.md) can be published to npm using the `updater-foo` naming convention, where `foo` is the updater's [alias](docs/faq.md#aliases).
- Run multiple updaters by passing a list of names after `update`. Example `$ update foo bar baz` will run updaters foo, bar and baz _in series_. The "next" updater always waits for the previous to finish.
- Updaters can have tasks, which are powered by [bach][] and use the same conventions as [gulp][]
- To run a task on an updater, do `$ update foo:abc`, where `abc` is the task name
- To run multiple tasks on an updater, do `$ update foo:abc,xyz`, where `abc` and `xyz` are task names
- Updaters that are published to npm can be [installed locally or globally](docs/installing-updaters.md)
- If you add an [updatefile.js](docs/updatefile.md) to the current working directory, Update's CLI will load it and register it as the ["default" updater](docs/updaters.md#default-updater).
- Update's CLI will look on the default updater for tasks and (other) updaters to run before looking elsewhere.

## Fast track

Install `update` and the example "updater" with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global update updater-license
```

Make sure your work is committed, then run:

```sh
$ update license
```

## Getting started

This section just covers the essentials, more detail is [provided below](#table-of-contents) and in the [docs/](docs) folder.

**Installing Update**

To use the CLI, update must first be installed globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --global update
```

This adds the `update` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from anywhere.

**Installing updaters**

To see how updaters work, install `updater-example`:

```sh
$ npm install --global updater-example
```

**Running updaters**

Add a file named `example.txt` to the current working directory, then run `updater-example` with the following command:

```sh
$ update example
```

Next, try the following steps to get familiarized with how update works:

- [ ] run `$ update example` to execute the default task, which will append the string `foo` to the file's contents.
- [ ] run `$ update example:foo` to execute the `foo` task, appending the string `foo` to the file's contents
- [ ] run `$ update example:bar` to execute the `bar` task, appending the string `bar` to the file's contents
- [ ] run `$ update example.abc` to execute the default task on the `abc` (sub-)updater, appending the string `abc:one` to the file's contents
- [ ] run `$ update example.abc:one` to execute the `one` task on the `abc` (sub-)updater, appending the string `abc:one` to the file's contents


**Init**

Now that you know how to run an updater directly, you can tell update to store a list of one or more updaters to run each time the `update` command is given:

```sh
$ update init
```

Whenever you install new updaters you can run `update init` to update your preferences.

Visit the [documentation](docs) for details about authoring an publishing updaters. 

## Features

* **unparalleled flow control**: through the use of [updaters][getting-started], [sub-updaters][getting-started] and [tasks][getting-started]
* **templates, scaffolds and boilerplates**: update a single file, initialize an entire project, or provide ad-hoc "components" throughout the duration of a project using any combination of [templates, scaffolds and boilerplates](#templates-scaffolds-and-boilerplates).
* **any engine**: use any template engine to render templates, including [handlebars][], [lodash][], [swig][] and [pug][]
* **prompts**: asks you for data when it can't find what it needs, and it's easy to customize prompts for any data you want.
* **data**: gathers data from the user's environment to populate "hints" in user prompts and render templates
* **streams**: interact with the file system, with full support for [gulp][] and [assemble][] plugins
* **smart plugins**: Update is built on [base][], so any "smart" plugin can be used
* **stores**: persist configuration settings, global defaults, project-specific defaults, answers to prompts, and so on.
