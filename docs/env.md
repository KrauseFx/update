# Environment

At a high level, the `env` object provides easy-access to information about certain "environment" details, like the user's working directory, filepaths to generators or updatefiles, and so on. 

There are three main properties on the `env` object, each is an object with additional properties:

- [env.user](#env-user)
- [env.config](#env-config)
- [env.module](#env-module)
